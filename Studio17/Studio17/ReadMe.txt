i tested all methods by creating image file, getting the name, writing a valid vector to it, trying to append(fails appropriately), 
and i also tryed writing a ill-formated vector which did not work

output:
"created new text file named: test
added image to file. here is what is in the file now
X X
 X
X X
this is size: 9
When appending item, should return 2 indicating it is an invalid function: 2
Trying to write vector that isnt formated right
this is size: 0"

3. the benefits are that programming to an interface allows for more of a flexibility, because the implementation of the functions that 
the interface uses can be changed as it needs to be. For example, as things change in the future, you will still be able to use the interface
and you just have to change how the client uses it.
