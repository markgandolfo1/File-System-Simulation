3. the advantages of this would be that it is more flexible, and it allows the file systems to not worry about the types of file. the disadvantages i guess would be that the file system can no longer create files, but this is not really that big of a deal. we might want to create a new file factory.
4. the test i ran constructed a filesystem and a filefactory, added a text file created through the factory into the system, wrote "hi" to the file, successfully opened the file, read the file, and then closed the file
the output was "hi" because this is what i wrote to the file.

5. the simplefilesystem only depends on abstractfile types.
